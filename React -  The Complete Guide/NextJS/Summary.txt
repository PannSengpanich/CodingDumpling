Forms of Pre-Rendering

1. Server Side Rendering (SSR) = 
                                - Preparing the content of a page on the server instead of on the client (pre-render pages)
                                - improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
                                - No flickering loading state
                                - uses getServerSideProps()
                                - regenerated every request
                                - (most up to date)
                               


(should use)
2. Static Site Generation (SSG) = 
                                  - page component is re-rendered when building application
                                  - page is pre-render when build on prod instead of when request reaches the server.
                                  - uses getStaticProps(), getStaticPaths() (async function)
                                    (will executed during build process, not on client side)
                                  - (not up to date) 


(should use)
3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) = SSG + revalidate
                                         - will be regenerated every x seconds and replaces old pre-generated page (data will never older than x sec)
                                         - dont have to rebuild, redeploy all the time
                                         - faster than SSR
                                         - (up to date)
